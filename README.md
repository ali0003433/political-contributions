# Predicting the Recipient of 2020 Presidential Campaign Contributions

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is two-fold. The first goal was to create a multi-class classifier for predicting the recipient on an individual's campaign contributions. The second goal was to tune the model to optimize for predicting a specific metric, namely contributions to Bernie Sanders in this particular example. 

### Technologies/Libraries

* Jupyter
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* pandas
* Python
* scikit-learn

## Project Description
- The first data source is the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) individual contributions data for the District of Columbia pulled on October 18, 2019
- The second data source is the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) from 2015 for the District of Columbia 
- Feature engineering of FEC and Census Bureau data
-  Model selection using logistic regression, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest 
-  One classifier optimized for a target candidate
