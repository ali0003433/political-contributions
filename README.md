# Predicting the Recipient of 2020 Presidential Campaign Contributions

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is two-fold. The first goal was to create a multi-class classifier for predicting the recipient on an individual's campaign contributions. The second goal was to tune the model to optimize for predicting a specific metric, namely contributions to Bernie Sanders in this particular example. 

### Technologies/Libraries
* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* sqlite3
* Matplotlib
